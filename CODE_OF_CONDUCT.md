# Contributor Code of Conduct

As contributors and maintainers of the Spatial Simulation Experiment Project, we respect all people who participate. All contributions received via email, by way of reporting issues, posting update requests, updating documentation, submitting pull requests, and other activities will be treated with respect.

We are dedicated to making participation in this project a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of level of experience, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, or religion.
Project maintainers have the responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, edits, issues, and other contributions that are disrespectful. 

Occurrences of offensive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior can be resolved by contacting one or more of the project maintainers.
